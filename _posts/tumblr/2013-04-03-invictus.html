<p>Out of the night that covers me,<br/> Black as the pit from pole to pole,<br/> I thank whatever gods may be<br/> For my unconquerable soul.<br/><br/> In the fell clutch of circumstance<br/> I have not winced nor cried aloud.<br/> Under the bludgeonings of chance<br/> My head is bloody, but unbowed.<br/><br/> Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br/> Looms but the Horror of the shade,<br/> And yet the menace of the years<br/> Finds and shall find me unafraid.<br/><br/> It matters not how strait the gate,<br/> How charged with punishments the scroll.<br/> I am the master of my fate:<br/> I am the captain of my soul.</p>
