<p>A noble host invited a distinguished guest to dinner. To honor him, the nobleman instructed the cook to serve roast stork. The servant was a very good cook, and he roasted the stork to perfection. In fact, the odor was so delicious that he could not resist cutting off one leg and eating it himself. Then he carefully placed the stork on its side and served the platter at dinner.</p>
<p>The nobleman was greatly perturbed when he saw the stork had one leg missing. He tried to retain his composure, ignored the mutilation, and treated his guest with extraordinary politeness. But he vowed inwardly to cover his outrageous cook with confusion. On the morrow therefore he led his servant into castle yard and pointed to a stork standing there at distance. Storks have two legs, he said, what did you do with the stork&rsquo;s other leg last night?</p>
<p>But look, said the cook, storks have only one leg. The stork in the yard was standing on one leg, as storks often do. Not to be outdone, the nobleman clapped his hands; at the noise the stork put down his other leg and flew away. See, he said to to the cook, storks have two legs. But, replied the cook, last night you did not clap your hands.</p>
