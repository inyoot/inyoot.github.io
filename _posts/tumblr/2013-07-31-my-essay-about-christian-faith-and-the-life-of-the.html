<p>I chose to study at Baylor University because of the talks and living examples from Dr. Walter Bradley on the integration of faith and the mind. As a Christian scientist and engineer, I would like to start explaining the relationship between Christian faith and the life of the mind with Genesis 2:7. God very uniquely created the human being as the crown of creation. God not only took great fatherly care to mold man from the dust, but also breathed His Spirit into his nostril. In short, man was created in God’s image and His likeness (Gen 1:26-27), intellectually and spiritually. Thus, it can be inferred that faith and mind are interwoven together inseparably. When faith and mind explore and respond to God&rsquo;s creation and life itself, we have science in a very broad sense. When faith and mind explore and respond to afterlife and God, we have religion. As Einstein said, “Science without religion is lame; religion without science is blind.” I will use these two statements as a framework to further elaborate my thesis.</p>

<p>First, science without religion is lame. Romans 1:19-20 teaches that when men explore the cosmos, they not only understand matters pertaining to physical things, but also have the capacity to understand what is beyond the physical, that is the knowledge of the true God, and even His invisible attributes. When we—scientists and engineers—discover new things, we are always imaginatively compelled to ask more profound questions pertaining to new invention and to grasp a deeper understanding beyond the physical. Einstein understood and articulated this concept as follows: “Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand.” We must see beyond the infinitely many possibilities that science offers, and that all magnificent discoveries in science should also show God’s eternal power and divine nature. This is the reason why I am doing my research under Dr. Robert Marks II who is well known in intelligent design and, with his unwavering Christian faith, tries to follow every scientific fact wherever it leads. The God-given mind is limited and that sin severely depraves it; consequently, science is limited as can be seen in Gödel&rsquo;s incompleteness theorem and the incapability of science to answer metaphysical and ethical questions. All intellectual pursuits therefore must begin and end with faith. Thus, faith to the supremacy of Christ gives a sense of direction in the midst of uncertainties and redeems the mind to a higher truth. Faith is the foundation and the summit of the life of the mind.</p>

<p>Second, religion without science is blind. When we are infants, we do not yet utilize our minds and intellects. All of us by faith simply believe in whoever or whatever our parents are. Likewise, in science we always firstly believe that presuppositions, hypotheses, axioms, and assumptions are true. Sometimes, it even cannot be verified or falsified. In all areas of life, we always begin with faith, and, as Augustine and Anselm said, faith must seek understanding. Without understanding, faith becomes blind faith. Dark historical epochs of the church such as the medieval witch hunt, sale of indulgences, and the Roman Inquisition trials and the Papal condemnation of Galileo exemplify this tragedy. In fact, the Bible exhorts us to test everything, and especially, to test the spirit (1 Thess 5:21, 1 John 4:1) and not to be content with blind faith. Beginning with believing and then seeking understanding, we will arrive at a qualitatively more mature faith that is in continuity with our understanding. As faith and the mind are inseparable, both are limited and corrupted. Unless God replaces our hearts of stone with the new hearts and new spirits, we can only reject and keep suppressing the truth specially the knowledge of the true God and His invisible attributes that is already revealed to us in nature (Eze 36:26, Rom 1: 18). In summary, the role of regenerated mind is to purify our faith from superstition, guard us from the heretics, help us to understand and proclaim God.</p>

<p><strong>References</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Gen 2:7 </strong>then the Lord God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature.</p>

<p><strong>Gen 1:26-27 </strong>Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.” So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.</p>

<p><strong>Rom 1:18-20</strong> The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people, who suppress the truth by their wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.</p>

<p><strong>1 Thess 5:21</strong> but test everything; hold fast what is good.</p>

<p><strong>1 John 4:1</strong> Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world.</p>

<p><strong>Ez</strong><strong>e</strong><strong> 36:26</strong> And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.</p>
