<p>Good conduct leaves behind no traces.<br/>Good words afford no room for criticism.<br/>Good mathematicians require no abacus.<br/>Good doors need no bolts, and are not easily opened.<br/>Good teachers do not need anything to bind their students to them.</p><p>The wise man, by his abiding goodness, saves other<br/>because he spurns no one.<br/>He, by his abiding goodness, saves the inanimate creation<br/>because he spurn nothing.<br/>This is called applied intelligence.</p><p>Therefore the good man is the bad man’s teacher.<br/>And the bad man can serve as a lesson for good man.<br/>When one fails to esteem his teacher…. <br/>Or the other fails to value his lesson, <br/>Each is under great delusion,<br/>though each may be learned.</p><p>The sage follow his nature in his relationship with people and the world at large.<br/>He is able to treat good and the bad with goodness for he has no ego.</p>
