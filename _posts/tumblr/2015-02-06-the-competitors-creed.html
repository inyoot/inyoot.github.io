<p>I am a Christian first and last.<br/>I am created in the likeness of <br/>God Almighty to bring Him glory.<br/>I am a member of Team Jesus Christ.<br/>I wear the colors of the cross.</p><p>I am a Competitor now and forever.<br/>I am made to strive, to strain,<br/>to stretch and to succeed<br/>in the arena of competition.<br/>I am a Christian Competitor<br/>and as such, I face my challenger<br/>with the face of Christ.</p><p>I do not trust in myself.<br/>I do not boast in my abilities<br/>or believe in my own strength.<br/>I rely solely on the power of God.<br/>I compete for the pleasure of<br/>my Heavenly Father, the honor of Christ<br/>and the reputation of the Holy Spirit.</p><p>My attitude on and off<br/>the field is above reproach -<br/>my conduct beyond criticism.<br/>Whether I am preparing,<br/>practicing or playing;<br/>I submit to God’s authority<br/>and those He has put over me.<br/>I respect my coaches, officials,<br/>teammates and competitors <br/>out of respect for the Lord.</p><p>My body is the temple of Jesus Christ.<br/>I protect it from within and without.<br/>Nothing enters my body that<br/>does not honor the Living God.<br/>My sweat is an offering to my Master.<br/>My soreness is a sacrifice to my Savior.</p><p>I give my all – all of the time.<br/>I do not give up. I do not give in.<br/>I do not give out. I am the Lord’s warrior -<br/>a competitor by conviction<br/>and a disciple of determination.<br/>I am confident beyond reason<br/>because my confidence lies in Christ.<br/>The results of my efforts<br/>must result in His glory.</p><p>LET THE COMPETITION BEGIN.<br/>LET THE GLORY BE GOD’S.</p><p>Fellowship of Christian Athletes (<a href="http://www.fca.org/quick-links/the-competitors-creed/2/" target="_blank">http://www.fca.org/quick-links/the-competitors-creed/2/</a>)</p>
