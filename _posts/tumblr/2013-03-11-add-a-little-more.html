<p>We recall the kind old grocer,<br/>when the sugar he would pour;<br/>How he carefully tilted the balance;<br/>then he would add a little more.</p>
<p>And his business - how is prospered,<br/>folks would flock into his store;<br/>For he gave an honest measure;<br/>then he would add a little more.</p>
<p>And so it is with life my students,<br/>you can make a bigger score;<br/>If when you do what is expected;<br/>you just added a little more.</p>
