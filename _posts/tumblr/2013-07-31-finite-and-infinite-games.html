<p>There are at least two kinds of games. One could be called finite, the other infinite.</p>
<p>A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing the play.</p>
<p>Finite players play within boundaries; infinite player play with boundaries.</p>
<p>Surprise causes finite play to end; it is the reason for infinite play to continue.</p>
<p>To be prepared against <span class="gmw_">surprise is to be trained. To be prepared for<span class="gm_ gm_85f06fe9-92e1-db6b-5e9f-30fedb2095f1 gm-spell gm_tiny"> </span>surprise is to be educated.</span></p>
<p><span class="gmw_">The finite play for serious; the infinite play of life is joyous.<br/></span></p>
<p><span class="gmw_">The joyfulness of infinite play, its laughter, lies in learning to start something we cannot finish.<br/></span></p>
<p><span class="gmw_"><span class="gmw_">No one can play<span class="gm_ gm_1a083189-788d-4c00-dc90-f5a825057f04 gm-spell gm_tiny"> </span>game alone. One cannot be human by oneself.</span><br/></span></p>
<p>Our social existence has &hellip; an inescapably fluid character.<span class="gmw_"><br/></span></p>
<p>&hellip; we are not the stones over which the stream of the worlds flows; we are the stream itself.</p>
<p>Change itself is the very basis of our continuity as persons.</p>
<p>Only that which can change can continue: this is the principle by which infinite player live.</p>
<p>James P. Carse</p>
