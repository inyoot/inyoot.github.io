<p>One man boasted, &ldquo;My bow is so good, it needs no arrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another man boasted, &ldquo;My arrow so good, it needs no bow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The skilled archer Yi heard them and said, &ldquo;Without a bow, how can you shoot an arrow? And without an arrow how can you hit the target?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the bow and the arrow were used together, and Yi taught these men to shoot.</p>
