<p>A man was going to take up an official post. A close friend came to see him off. &ldquo;One thing you must remember when you become an official,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is that you must always be patient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man replied that he would. His friend the repeated his advice three times, and three times the man nodded in assent. When for the fourth time his friend repeated his counsel, the man became angry and said, &ldquo;Do you take me for an idiot? Why do you repeat such simple thing over and over again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His friend sighed. &ldquo;It is not easy to be patience, see!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have only said that a few times, and here you already impatient.&rdquo;</p>
