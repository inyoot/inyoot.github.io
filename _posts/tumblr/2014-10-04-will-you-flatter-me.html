<p>A rich man and poor man were talking together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a hundred ounces of gold,&rdquo; said the rich man. &ldquo;If I give you twenty, will you flatter me?&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;It would not be fairly shared, so how could I flatter you?&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;Suppose I give you half, would you flatter me then?&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;We would be equal. I would not flatter you.&rdquo;<br/>And if I give you all the gold, how then?&ldquo;<br/>&quot;If I have all the gold. I would have no need to flatter you.&rdquo;<br/>(Ai Zi Wai Yu)</p>
