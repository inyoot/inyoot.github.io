<p><span>The 90-mile mark is the half point of a 100-mile journey. (Chinese proverb)</span></p>
<p><span>Rev. Stephen Tong, in one of his sermons, tells a story of Zhou Enlai. Zhou Enlai was asked by the Americans why Chinese people have bent backs, unlike the American people who have a straighter and sturdier posture. Zhou Enlai answer is very brilliant. He said because Chinese people are climbing the mountain and Americans are coming down from the mountain.</span></p>
<p><span>We do not know whether this story is true or not. But Zhou Enlai starts one of his talks with the Chinese proverb that we wrote in the beginning of this reflection. This New Year, we celebrated our ninth year of marriage -a half way point of 10 years marriage. We are so grateful that we have each other and we pray that our family will someday grow bigger.</span></p>
<p><span>A year ago, we had a lot happening. Iwan had finished classes, and passed his qualifying exam. Finishing the exam always means going to a higher level, so Iwan got a bigger responsibility, he needed to do his own research. Metta also started her journey as a seminary student. Since she became a student, she started to work too. She works in the library and is busy delivering books around the campus. Both of us have a really hectic schedule. Both of us take turns to do daily chores such as cooking, cleaning, and laundry. Both of us have our own stresses. And both of us are really appreciative of a long break, just like this memorable Christmas break that just passed.</span></p>
<p><span>Time is so limited and there are so many things to do: school, work, ministry, community, and family. Reflecting back on the year, there is no way we could have done it ourselves. We believe that God has dealt graciously with us.This past year was hard on us. We struggled a lot with our own laziness, our sins, and our pasts. We know we have harder years ahead because our struggle is never finished.</span></p>
<p><span>Like the Chinese saying, we are surely climbing the mountain of scholar. When we were in our first years, it must be an easy slope to climb, so we felt like we ran with a lot of laughter. But now, we are on a steeper climb of the mountain. We started to be tired after a long run. Ransom became thinner. The air also became thinner. All the resources are very limited now. The last stretch of climbing is the most difficult. We have to squeeze everything. We complained and cried, but still we walk. We still cannot see the top of the mountain, but know we will reach it someday if we keep walking. We have hope and we donâ€™t give up. We have each other and we are holding each other hands. Together we climb and sing the hymn that we also sang when we first started this walk together: I know who holds tomorrow.</span></p>
