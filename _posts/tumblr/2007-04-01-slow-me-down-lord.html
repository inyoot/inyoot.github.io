<p>Ease the pounding of my heart by the quieting of my mind.<br/></p><p>Steady my hurried pace with a vision of the eternal reach of time</p><p>Give me, amid the confusion of the day, the calmness of the everlasting hills.</p><p>Break the tensions of my nerves and muscles with the soothing music of the singing stream that live in my memory.</p><p>Teach me the art of taking minute vacations—of slowing down to look a flower, to chat with a friend, to pat a dog, to smile at child, to read a few lines from a good book.</p><p>Slow me down, Lord, and inspire me to send my roots deep into soil of life’s enduring values, that I may grow toward my greater destiny.</p><p>Remind me each day that race is not always to the swift; that there is more to life than increasing its speed.</p><p>Let met look upward to the towering oak and know that it grew great and strong because it grew slowly and well</p><p>Orin L. Crain</p>
