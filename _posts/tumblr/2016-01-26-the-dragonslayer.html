<p>Zhuphing Man was an avid sword fighter. One day, in hopes of studying the art of dragonslaying, he went to see Zhili Yi. After studying for three years and spending one thousand gold pieces of the family savings, he finally graduated and descended the mountain. He immediately get out to find a dragon to test out his new skill. Zhuping Man crisscrossed the land, but just couldnâ€™t find a dragon. Zhuphing Man dreamed of killing a dragon and went so far as learning the art of dragonslaying, but who knows if he could slay even a little puppy dog, let alone a dragon?</p><p>Zhuangzi Speaks pp. 120-121.</p>
