<p>A blind man and his dog walk down the road. The dog begins to piss on his legs. </p>
<p>The blind man offers the dog a cookie. </p>
<p>A man next him to says &ldquo; Why are you giving him a cookie for when your dog is pissing on your legs?&rdquo;. </p>
<p>The blind man replied,&ldquo;So when my dog stands up to reach for the cookie, I can kick him in the ass.&rdquo;</p>
