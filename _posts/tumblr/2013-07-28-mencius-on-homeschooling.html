<p><span class="gmw_">Kung-sun <span class="gm_ gm_088ec0e8-0edb-cea1-2eba-322fec709e70 gm-spell">Ch'ou</span> said: &ldquo;Why is it the noble-minded never teach their own children?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="gmw_">&ldquo;The way people are, it&rsquo;s impossible,&rdquo; replied Mencius.<br/></span></p>
<p><span class="gmw_">&ldquo;A teacher&rsquo;s task is to perfect the student, and if the student doesn&rsquo;t improve, the teacher gets angry. When the teacher gets angry, the student in turn feels hurt: You demand perfection, but you&rsquo;re nowhere near perfect yourself. So father and son would only hurt each other. And it&rsquo;s a tragedy when fathers and sons hurt each other.&rdquo;<br/></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The ancients taught each other&rsquo;s children. That way father and son never demand perfect virtue of one another. If they demand perfect virtue of one another, they grow distant. And nothing is more ominous than fathers and sons grown distant from one another.&rdquo;<span class="gmw_"><br/></span></p>
<p>(VII:Li Lou, Book One, 18)</p>
<p>&hellip; <br/>Chang and his father had falling out because they tried to reform each other. Between friends, reform is fine. But between fathers and sons, it&rsquo;s a great destroyer of love. &hellip;</p>
<p>(VIII:Li Lou, Book Two, 30 )</p>
