<p>The blessed door was closed a long time for an ancient people.<br/>A  mission fulfilled when the blood from the Cross became a stream.<br/>And  grace a hundred-fold flowed from the West.<br/>His body surrounded by  soldiers walking the midnight road,<br/>A disciple turned his back three  times before the rooster crowed.<br/>As five thousand whips broke his arm,<br/>Six feet tall, he hung there, together with two thieves.<br/>Tragedy shoot  the furthest places and the highest officials.<br/>After seven words it was  finished and millions of souls cry out.<br/>The way to Heaven depends on  God&rsquo;s Son.</p>
