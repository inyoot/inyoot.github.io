<p>God grant me the serenity<br/>to accept the things I cannot change;<br/>courage to change the things I can;<br/>and wisdom to know the difference.<br/><br/>Living one day at a time;<br/>Enjoying one moment at a time;<br/>Accepting hardships as the pathway to peace;<br/>Taking, as He did, this sinful world<br/>as it is, not as I would have it;<br/>Trusting that He will make all things right<br/>if I surrender to His Will;<br/>That I may be reasonably happy in this life<br/>and supremely happy with Him<br/>Forever in the next.<br/>Amen.</p>
<p><em>Reinhold Niebuhr</em></p>
