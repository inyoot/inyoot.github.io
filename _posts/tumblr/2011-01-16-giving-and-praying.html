<p>I was reading the story of a good old deacon in Maine, America, who came into a meeting after there had been missionary collection. The minister there and then asked &ldquo;our good brother Sewell&rdquo; to pray. Sewell did not pray, but thrust his hand in his pocket and stood fumbling about. &ldquo;Bring the box,&rdquo; he said. When the box came and he had put his money into it, the minister said, &ldquo;Brother Sewell, I did not ask you to give anything, I only wished you to pray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said he, Â <strong>I could not pray until I had first given something.</strong>&ldquo; He felt obliged first to do something for the great mission work, and having done that he could pray for it. Oh, that ALL Christ&rsquo;s people felt the justice of that course of conduct! Is it not most natural and proper?</p>
