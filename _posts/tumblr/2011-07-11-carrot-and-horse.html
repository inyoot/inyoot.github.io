<p>Once upon the time there was a gardener who grew an enormous carrot. So he took it to his king and said, &ldquo;My lord, this is the greatest carrot I&rsquo;ve ever grown or ever will grow. Therefore I want to present it to you as a token of my love and respect for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king was touched and discerned the man&rsquo;s heart, so as he turned to go the king said, &ldquo;Wait! You are clearly a good steward of the earth. I own a plot land right next to yours. I want to give it to you freely as a gift so you can garden it all.&rdquo; And the gardener was amazed and delighted and went home rejoicing.</p>
<p>But there was a nobleman at the king&rsquo;s court who overheard all this. And he said, &ldquo;My! If that is what you get for a carrot&ndash;what if you gave king something better?&rdquo; So the next day the nobleman came before king and he was leading a handsome black stallion. He bowed low and said &ldquo;My Lord, I breed horses and this is the greatest horse I&rsquo;ve ever bred or ever will. Therefore, I want to present it to you as a token of my love and respect for you.&rdquo; But the king discerned his heart and said thank you, and took the horse and merely dismissed him.</p>
<p>The nobleman was perplexed. So the king said, &ldquo;Let me explain. That gardener was giving <em>me</em> the carrot but you were giving your<em>self</em> the horse.&rdquo;</p>
