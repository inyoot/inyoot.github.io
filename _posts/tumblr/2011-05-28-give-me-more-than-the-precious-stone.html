<p>A monk in his travels once found a precious stone and kept it. One day he met a traveller, and when the monk opened his bag to share his provisions with him, the traveller saw the jewel and ask the monk to give it to him. The monk did so readily, The traveller departed, overjoyed with the unexpected gift of the precious stone, that was enough to give him wealth and security for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>However, a few days later he came back in search of the monk, Â found him, gave him back the stone, and entreated him, &ldquo;Now give me something much more precious than this stone, valuable as it is. Give me that which enabled you to give it to me&rdquo;</p>
