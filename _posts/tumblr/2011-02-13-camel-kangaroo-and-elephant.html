<p>One day a little boy came to his father. &ldquo;Today the teacher showed us a big round globe. She said was a model of the world. She said the world was just surrounded by space. How can that be? Dad, what holds up the world? Why doesn&rsquo;t it just fall down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father, knowing that this was just a child&rsquo;s question, gave him a child&rsquo;s answer: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a camel holds up the world, son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy went away satisfied, for he trusted his father and for the moment it made sense. He&rsquo;d seen pictures of camels holding up all sorts of things. So why not the world? But then he got to thinking about it and by the next day decided something was missing in his father&rsquo;s answer. He asked, &ldquo;Dad, I was just wondering: if camel holds up the world, what holds up the camel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father now thought that he might be in trouble. So, knowing that quick answer turneth away further questions, he said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a kangaroo that holds up the camel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the boy went away, but this time only for couple of hours. Back again with his father, he asked, &ldquo;Dad, if camel holds up the world and kangaroo holds up the camel, what holds up the kangaroo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time the father realized that he was in deep trouble. So he chose the largest animal he could think of and he put a capital on it. That is, he shouted. People believed you if you shout, he thought. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an Elephant holds up the kangaroo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Dad!&rdquo; his son retorted. &ldquo;What holds up the Elephant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father, in a fit of genius deriving from necessity, replied, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s&hellip; it&rsquo;s&hellip; it&rsquo;s Elephant all the way down.</p>
