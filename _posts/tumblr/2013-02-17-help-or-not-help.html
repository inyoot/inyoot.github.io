<p>A man in the state of Song was anxious day and night that his rice shoots were not growing fast enough. He hit upon a idea one day. He came to his plot and pulled up every one of the young shoots so that they all looked higher. When he returned home, he said to his family, &ldquo;I am tired out today. But the rice in the field has grown higher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Puzzled by his words, his son ran to the field and saw that all young rice shoot had whithered. </p>
