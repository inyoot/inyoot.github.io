<p>A man walking along the river bank saw someone about to throw a small boy into the water. The child screaming with terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you want to throw that child into the river? asked the passer-by.<br/><br/>&quot;His father is a good swimmer,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>But it does not follow that the son of good swimmer can swim.</p>
