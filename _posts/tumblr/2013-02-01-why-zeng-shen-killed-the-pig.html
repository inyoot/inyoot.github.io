<p>One day, when Zeng Shen&rsquo;s wife was going to the market, their son cried and clamoured to go with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back now!&rdquo; she wheedled him. &ldquo;When I get home we&rsquo;ll kill the pig for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon her return, she found Zeng Shen about to kill the pig. She hastily stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t really mean it,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;I just said that to keep the boy quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you deceive a child like that?&rdquo; asked Zeng Shen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Children know nothing to begin with, but they copy their parents and learn from them. When you cheat the boy,Â  you are teaching him to lie. If a mother deceive her child, he will not trust her, and that is no way to bring him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he killed the pig after all.</p>
<p>(Han Fei Zi)</p>
