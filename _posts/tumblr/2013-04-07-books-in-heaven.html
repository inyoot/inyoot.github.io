<p>&lsquo;Yes&rsquo;, my friend said. 'I don&rsquo;t see why there shouldn&rsquo;t be books in Heaven. But you will find that your library in Heaven contains only some of the books you had on earth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>'Which?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
<p>'The ones you gave away or lent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>'I hope the lent ones won&rsquo;t still have all the borrowers&rsquo; dirty thumb-marks,&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>'Oh yes they will,&rsquo; said he. 'But just as the wounds of the martyrs will have turned into beauties, so you will find that the thumb-marks have turned into beautiful illuminated capitals or exquisite marginal woodcuts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>(C. S. Lewis On Joy, p.54)</p>
