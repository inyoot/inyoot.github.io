<p>All of us have experienced being torn between *knowing* that something is good, and *not being able or willing to do it.* It is this tension which Paul recognizes: &ldquo;What I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do - this is what I keep on doing&rdquo; (Rom 7:19). This inbuilt human tendency to want to do what is wrong is reflected in the famous story about visitor to European monastery. This visitor was shown to his room by the monks. They told him that he could do anything he liked - providing he didn&rsquo;t look out of one of the windows. It was high up on the wall, far above the eye level. Eventually, he was unable to control his curiosity. Placing a chair below the window, he was able to reach far enough up to see out of this forbidden window - and was horrified to find the monks assembled there, awaiting his inevitable appearance. &ldquo;They always look out!&rdquo; was their final word, as they went away laughing.</p>
