<p>Make no mistake: if He rose at all<br/> it was as His body;<br/> if the cells’ dissolution did not reverse, the molecules<br/><span class="gmw_"> <span class="gm_ gm_2d26f47d-4079-4c90-285e-7dc474baa57b gm-spell">reknit</span>, the amino acids rekindle,</span><br/> the Church will fall.</p>
<p>It was not as the flowers,<br/> each soft Spring recurrent;<br/> it was not as His Spirit in the mouths and fuddled<br/> eyes of the eleven apostles;<br/> it was as His flesh: ours.</p>
<p>The same hinged thumbs and toes,<br/> the same valved heart<br/> that–pierced–died, withered, paused, and then<br/> regathered out of enduring Might<br/> new strength to enclose.</p>
<p>Let us not mock God with metaphor,<br/> analogy, sidestepping, transcendence;<br/> making of the event a parable, a sign painted in the<br/> faded credulity of earlier ages:<br/> let us walk through the door.</p>
<p><span class="gmw_">The stone is rolled back, not papier-<span class="gm_ gm_499e016c-42fd-9b5d-3b22-7f5f87cf87a2 gm-spell">mâché</span>,</span><br/> not a stone in a story,<br/> but the vast rock of materiality that in the slow<br/> grinding of time will eclipse for each of us<br/> the wide light of day.</p>
<p>And if we will have an angel at the tomb,<br/> make it a real angel,<br/> weighty with Max Planck’s quanta, vivid with hair,<br/> opaque in the dawn light, robed in real linen<br/> spun on a definite loom.</p>
<p>Let us not seek to make it less monstrous,<br/> for our own convenience, our own sense of beauty,<br/> lest, awakened in one unthinkable hour, we are<br/> embarrassed by the miracle,<br/> and crushed by remonstrance.</p>
<p>John Updike, 1960.</p>
