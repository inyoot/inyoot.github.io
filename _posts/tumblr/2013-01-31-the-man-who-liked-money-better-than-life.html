<p>In Yongzhou there were many good swimmer. One day, the river swelled suddenly. Braving the danger, about half a dozen people started across in a small boat. While they were still in midstream, the boat capsized. Whereupon, they started to swim. One though using his arms vigorously, seemed to make small progress.<br/> “You’re a better swimmer than any of us, why are you lagging behind?” asked his companions.<br/> “I have thousand coins tied around my loin,” said the man.<br/> “Why don’t you throw them away?” urged the others.<br/> He made no answer, shaking his head, although he was clearly in difficulties.<br/> The others reached the shore and shouted out to him: “Off with the coins, you fool! What’s the use of the money to you when you are drowning?”<br/> Still the man shook his head. In a few moments he was drowned.<br/> (Collected Works of Liu Zongyuan)</p>
