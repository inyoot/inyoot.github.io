<p>All this is reminiscent of the student at New York University who intimidatingly asked his professor, &ldquo;Sir, how do I know that I exist?&rdquo; A lingering pause preceded the professor&rsquo;s answer. He lowered his glasses, peered over the rim and riveted his eyes on the student. His simple response finally came, &ldquo;And whom shall I say is asking?&rdquo; Fortunately or otherwise, some things in life are just undeniable.</p>
