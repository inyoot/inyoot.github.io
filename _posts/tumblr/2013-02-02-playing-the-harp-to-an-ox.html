<p>One day Gong Mingyi, the celebrated musician, was playing an elegant tune on his harp to amuse a browning ox.</p>
<p>The ox, however, continued toÂ  munch, paying no heed to him at all.</p>
<p>Then he struck up some different notes, which sounded like mosquitoes droning and calves bleating. Whereupon the ox flicked its tail, pricked up its ears, and began frisking around and round, evidently absorbed in the music.</p>
<p>(Mou Zi)</p>
