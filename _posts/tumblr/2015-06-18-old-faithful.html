<p>They gather as they have gathered at the geyser<br/>hour by hour<br/>through the days and decades of summer,<br/>hundreds standing in the ring,<br/>hundreds sitting in the ring,<br/>where parents and grandparents<br/>and great grandparents stood,<br/>Waited and watched for the erupting of the spring:<br/>Steam and spray spouting in the air<br/>to the cheers and screams of the faithful<br/>who come and wait and watch<br/>to be rained upon by the sulfur rain<br/>Sent scurrying by the fount<br/>that sprinkled and sprayed<br/>other heads and shoulders<br/>who drew breath to ooh and ahhh<br/>At the ancient performance,<br/>receiving natures baptismal blessing<br/>before being buried in the earth.</p><p>Photo images remain of those who breathed<br/>and breathe no more,<br/>black and white images on paper.</p><p>Photo images appear of those who knew no breath<br/>Who now breathe,<br/>digital images,<br/>full color on the screen.</p><p>They stand each where the other stood<br/>The geyser spray towering over them as they stand<br/>Connecting them one to another<br/>across canyons of time.</p><p>(People, Places, Things Poems by William Tinsley, Loc 1491)</p>
