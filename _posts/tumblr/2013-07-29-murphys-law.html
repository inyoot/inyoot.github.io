<p>If anything can go wrong, it will.<br/>If anything can&rsquo;t go wrong, it still will.<br/>Nothing is ever as simple as it seems.<br/>Everything takes longer than you expect.<br/>Whatever you set out to do, something else must be done first.<br/>You can&rsquo;t do just one thing &ndash; there are always consequences.<br/>If everything seems to be going well, you have obviously overlooking something.<br/>Nature always sides with the hidden flaw.<br/><span class="gmw_">Mother Nature is a bitch.<br/>It&rsquo;s impossible to make anything foolproof, because fools are so ingenious.<br/><span class="gmw_">Always lie low &ndash; you can&rsquo;t fall off the floor.<br/>Never lose heart &ndash; they might want to cut it our.<br/>You can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time, and that&rsquo;s sufficient.</span></span></p>
