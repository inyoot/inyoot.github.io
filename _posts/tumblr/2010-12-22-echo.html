<p><span>A young man visiting Echo Canyon had been told that the canyon never failed to echo the sound of a human voice. He stepped up to the edge of the canyon, cupped his hand by his mouth, and shouted, &ldquo;Baloney!&rdquo; He waited for the echo, but none came. He thought perhaps he had not shouted loud enough, so he tried again. &ldquo;BALONEY!&rdquo; he shouted even louder. Still there was no echo. Finally, he shouted at the top of his lungs, &ldquo;I AM THE GREATEST PERSON IN THE WORLD!&rdquo; About that time he heard the echo of his first shout, &ldquo;Baloney!&rdquo;</span></p>
