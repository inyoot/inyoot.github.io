<p>Lord She was so fond of dragons that he had them painted and carved all over his house. When the real dragon in heaven heard about this, it s flew down and put its head through Lord Sheâ€™s door and its tail through one of his windows. When the Lord saw this he fled.</p>

<p>This shows that the Lord was not really fond of dragons. He liked all that looked like dragons, but not the genuine thing. (Shen Zi)</p>
