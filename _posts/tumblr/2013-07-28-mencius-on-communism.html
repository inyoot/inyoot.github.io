<p><br/>&hellip;<br/><span class="gmw_">&ldquo;In Master <span class="gm_ gm_27a921bd-8d67-7516-d339-16c4ee395b5d gm-spell">Hsu</span>&rsquo;s Way, market price should all be the same. He claims that would end deceit, that even if children were sent to market, no one cheat them. Cloth of the same length would bring the same price, whether it was cotton or silk. Bundled fiber of the same weight would bring the same price for the same measure, and shoes would bring the same price for the same size.&rdquo;</span><br/><span class="gmw_">&ldquo;But inequality is the very nature of things. One thing may be two or five times as valuable as another, or perhaps ten or a hundred times, or even a thousand or ten thousand times. If you tried to make everything equal value, confusion would reign in all the beneath Heaven. If elegant shoes and workaday shoes brought the same price, who would bother to make elegant shoes? If we follow the Way of Master <span class="gm_ gm_d99abef0-bd2d-2a29-ecfd-699e2a5bf8e1 gm-spell">Hsu</span>, we&rsquo;ll lead each other into utter deceit. How could a nation be governed this way?&rdquo;</span><br/><br/>(V: Duke Wen of T'eng, Book One,4)</p>
