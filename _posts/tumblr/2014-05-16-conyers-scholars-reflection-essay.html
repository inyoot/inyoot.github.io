<p><span>In <a href="http://inyoot.tumblr.com/post/59884957341/my-essay-about-christian-faith-and-the-life-of-the-mind" target="_blank">my first essay</a>, I explained the relationship between Christian faith and the life of the mind; they are interwoven together inseparably. In our search for the truth through science and religion, we need both of them - faith and mind. The practice of <a href="http://www.baylor.edu/graduate/currentstudents/index.php?id=98831" target="_blank">Conyers Scholars</a> has sharpened my understanding of this relationship between Christian faith and the life of the mind.</span></p>
<p><span>When I read  A. J. Conyers’ paper, especially about the Pauline metaphor, I can see that faith and mind are members of one  body, instead of Siamese twins, who share vital organs. In a similar analogy, Parker J. Palmer used Robert Frost&rsquo;s metaphor &ldquo;as my two eyes make one sight.&rdquo; The eye of faith and the eye of mind should produce one image instead of two images. We need both wings (faith and mind) to soar beyond our finite and existing reality in order to find divine love in our never-ending search for the truth. Faith and mind as members of one body exist not for themselves but for the sake of the body. If faith and mind do not care about their interdependence then they will become ignorant and fall into “</span><em>acedia</em><span>” (sin of whatever). They become cancer cells that destroy the whole body.</span></p>
<p><span>We also exist not for ourselves. We, though many, are one body in Christ and individually members of one another. We all have gifts that differ according to  the grace given to us. Some of us are very gifted in research, some in service, and others in teaching. Let us not think of ourselves more highly than we ought to think. Let us look not only to our own interests, but also to the interests of others. In humility, we should count others more significant than ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span>In learning, we must be a lover who returns the embrace and the love from God, the Creator. Instead of being a master who controls, possesses, and cuts off relationships (objectivism), we should be obedient to the truth and not only listen to our own voice (subjectivism). Only because we are created in His image (</span><em>Imago Dei</em><span>), can we do re-”search” and discovery of the truth. Only by realizing that we have a trace of the Lord in us (</span><em>Vestigium Domini</em><span>),  can we re-”member” any truth, to  bring the separated parts  of the community of truth back together, to reunite the whole. What a powerful concept; far more superior than a similar concept in martial arts where a weapon is considered as a member of the body. </span></p>
<p><span>In the same way, teaching is to create a space in which obedience to the truth is practiced.  Love and truth shall kiss one another because love alone or truth alone is very dangerous. Love alone is similar to uncatechized appetite.  Our unbounded appetite (love) of turtles and quails makes turtles and quails suffer and die. Our appetite for learning becomes the curiosity that kills the cat. Unlimited space turns us into slackers. Love, the same as space, needs to be bounded by truth. Truth alone is also not sufficient. It&rsquo;s like putting God in the freezer. You just paid the bill and used God when is needed, a very cold legalism and objectivism. It is also like being &ldquo;used&rdquo; by God. It is losing our appetite and starving to death. That is why righteousness and bliss shall kiss each other.</span></p>
<p><span>Like Lazarus, we are raised from dead, made alive to the reality that we do not merely exist, but we are called forth to a divine purpose.  Only within this horizon of truth, will we understand our truest freedom in its fullness. By doing our vocations which often are against our own will, involving hardship in almost every case, and if we are not diverted or distracted, we will find our ultimate happiness. We are truly flourishing as human beings, becoming the supreme realization of our true self when we are fulfilling our divine purpose.</span></p>
