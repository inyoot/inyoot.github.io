<p>Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all offenses. (Proverbs 10:12)<br/>Whoever covers an offense seeks love, but he who repeats a matter separates close friends. (Proverbs 17:9)<br/>Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins. (1 Peter 4:8)</p>
<p>Talking with Confucius, the Lord of She said, In our district there&rsquo;s a fellow called Honest Body. When his father stole a sheep, the son testified against him.</p>
<p>Confucius said, In our district the honest people are different from that. A father covers up for his son; a son covers up for his father. There&rsquo;s honesty in that, too. (Lun Yu/The Analects of Confucius - Book 13:18)</p>
