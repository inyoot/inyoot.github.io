<p>A parable: A man was examining the construction of a cathedral. He asked a stone mason what he was doing chipping the stones, and the mason replied, “I am making stones.” He asked a stone carver what he was doing. “I am carving a gargoyle.” And so it went, each person said in detail what they were doing. Finally he came to an old woman who was sweeping the ground. She said. “I am helping build a cathedral.”<br/>&hellip;Most of the time each person is immersed in the details of one special part of the whole and does not think of how what they are doing relates to the larger picture.<br/>[For example, in education, a teacher might say in the next class he was going to “explain Young&rsquo;s modulus and how to measure it,” rather than, “I am going to educate the students and prepare them for their future careers.”] <br/>(The Art of Doing Science and Engineering: Learning to Learn by Richard Hamming, pp 195.)</p>
