<p>Talented people have so much work to do. Intelligent people have so much to worry about. But incompetent people go about oh-so-happily, seeking nothing and satisfied with enough to eat. Like an unmoored boat, drifting on the water, rocking gently back and forth, carefree and at ease.</p><p>People of ability and intelligence always bring on suffering and distress, which is something the average person often doesnâ€™t realize.</p><p>Zhuangzi Speaks pp. 119</p>
