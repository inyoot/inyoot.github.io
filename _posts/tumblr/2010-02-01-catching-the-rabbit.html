<h2>The Night the Rabbit Broke Down</h2><p>by Bob Buford after a conversation with Dallas Willard</p><p>It’s a false thing<br/>and all the yelping dogs must know it.<br/>But they’re caught up in the pure<br/>thrill of the chase,<br/>doing what they have been trained to do.</p><p>The starting bell clangs.<br/>The gate smash open,<br/>and out they come in hot pursuit.<br/>Adrenalin pumping.<br/>Eyes on the prize.</p><p>The mechanical rabbit bobbing ahead<br/>always pursued, never caught.<br/>The pell mell energy of the other<br/>dogs, all in a rush!</p><p>The vibrant, muscular pulse has a <br/>visceral charge to it that is more compelling<br/>than cool reason. The training<br/>takes over — not thinking,<br/>but raw action in response to<br/>known stimuli.</p><p>Like a middle linebacker when<br/>the ball is snapped–all instinct.</p><p>But one day–<br/>The bell rings,<br/>the gates open,<br/>the same mad rush down the track.</p><p>But then… something new, something unexpected<br/>and unprepared for happens–<br/>The dogs catch the rabbit!</p><p>Yecch! Is this what I’ve been<br/>chasing all these years?<br/>Surely this isn’t it!</p><p>Confusion reigns. The dogs don’t<br/>know what to do. They’re just<br/>leaping around, yelping,<br/>and biting one another.</p><p>What now? What next?<br/>No habit pattern to replace<br/>the instinctive logic of the<br/>race that has made unthinking<br/>sense of this mad dash.</p><p>The race itself was the thing.<br/>The hot pursuit that has given<br/>form and forward momentum to<br/>day after day.</p><p>Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow<br/>Got to eat<br/>Got to sleep<br/>Got to stay in shape.</p><p>Another season, another race,<br/>another chance to win,<br/>a plane to catch,<br/>a pitch to make,<br/>people to impress,<br/>a risk to take.</p><p>Another rabbit to chase,<br/>another trophy to win,<br/>it’s all momentum!</p><p>But what if the rabbit breaks down?<br/>then what?<br/>then what?<br/>Silence…<br/>even in the midst of pandemonium.</p><p>Silence…<br/>and God who inhabits the silence…<br/>God who has<br/>been there all along.</p><p>God, help me I pray.<br/>Give me another rabbit to chase,<br/>a new problem to solve,<br/>only this time:<br/>a rabbit that won’t break down,<br/>a rabbit that always stays ahead of me.</p><p>Give me a rabbit that’s<br/>worth chasing!</p>
