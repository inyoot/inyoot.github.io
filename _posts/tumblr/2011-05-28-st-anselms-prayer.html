<p>Lord, give me what you have made me want;<br/>I praise and thank you for the desire that you have inspired;<br/>Perfect what you have begun,<br/>and grant me what you have made me long for. </p>
<p>St. Anselm of Canterbury - shorter version</p>

<p>My light, you see my conscience,<br/>because, &lsquo;Lord, before you is all my desire&rsquo;,<br/>and if my soul wills any good, you gave it to me.</p>
<p>Lord, if what you inspire is good, <br/>or rather because it is good, that I should want to love You,<br/>give me what you have made me want:<br/>grant that I may attain to love you as much as you command&hellip;</p>
<p>Perfect what you have begun, <br/>and grant me what you have made me long for,<br/>not according to my deserts but out of your kindness that came first to me.</p>
<p>St. Anselm of Canterbury - longer version </p>
