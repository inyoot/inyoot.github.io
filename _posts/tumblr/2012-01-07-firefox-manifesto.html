<p>We believe in principle over profit.<br/><br/>We believe that secrecy is trumped by honesty.<br/><br/>And corporate interest by community.<br/><br/>We believe that the Web is more cared for than owned.<br/><br/>More of a resource to be tended to than a mere commodity to be sold.<br/><br/>And we strongly believe in innovation that puts users front, center, and squarely in the driver&rsquo;s seat.<br/><br/>But most importantly, we believe in you.<br/><br/>We believe that the world&rsquo;s best browser is made possible by engineers, programmers, designers and people just like you who give their time, talents, energy and support to the cause. And we believe that together, with this cause in mind, we can continue to innovate for the benefit of the individual and the betterment of the Web, so that it always and forever serves the greater good.<br/><br/>We are all Mozilla Firefox. And we&rsquo;re not just a different kind of browser.<br/><br/>We&rsquo;re a browser that is making a difference.</p>
