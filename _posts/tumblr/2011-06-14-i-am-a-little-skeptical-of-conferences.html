<p>Conferences are full of words. Words are often substitutes for action.</p>
<p>Mother Theresa was at  a conference once. She didn&rsquo;t like to go to conferences. This was an ecumenical conference. She was interested in ecumenism, so she sat patiently through four or five long theological talks. They asked her what she thought about them, and she said, &ldquo;They talk too much.&rdquo; They said, &ldquo;But, Mother, these are academics, these are theologians. They&rsquo;re eloquent. That&rsquo;s what they do. They talk. What else could they do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was in an outdoor tent and the floor was a bit dirty and there was a broom in the corner, so she answered the question by pointing to the broom. She said, &ldquo;Well, the floor is kind of dirty. One of them could have picked up the broom and swept the floor. That would have said more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think it would have. I don&rsquo;t think anyone remembered any sentence in any of those talks, but if one of those theologians would have picked up a broom they would have been talking about that until Christ came again.</p>
