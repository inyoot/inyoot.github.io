<p>&ldquo;I am seventy already,&rdquo; said Duke Ping of Jin to his blind musician Shi Kuang. &ldquo;Though I want very much to study and read some books, I feel it is too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why not light the candle?&rdquo; suggested Shi Kuang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare a subject joke with his master?&rdquo; cried the duke angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A blind musician, I dare not!&rdquo; protested Shi Kuang. &ldquo;But I have heard that ifÂ  a man is fond of study in his youth, his future is as bright as the morning sun; if he applies himself to study in middle age, it is like he noon-day sun; while if he begins to study when he is old, it is like a candle&rsquo;s flame. Though a candle is not very bright, at least it is better than groping in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The duke agreed with him.</p>
