<p>Early in the Song Dynasty, Emperor Taizong appointed a group of scholars to compile a stupendous encyclopedia - the Imperial Library of the Taiping Reign. It isÂ  a collection of 1000 volumes classified under fifty-five subjects. More than 1800 existing works were included in it. He set a rule for himself to read two or three volumes a day.</p>
<p>Some people said that since the Emperor had to deal with so many things every day, it was really too tiring for him to read the books. When the Emperor Taizong heard the comment, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in reading, and I find reading is always profitable. I don&rsquo;t feel tired at all.</p>
