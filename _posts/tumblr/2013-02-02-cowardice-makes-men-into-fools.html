<p>The city of Dingzhou was surrounded by the Tartar army. Sun Yangao, the prefect, was so frightened he no longer appeared at his official quarters, but shut himself in his private house and had the door bolted. Official documents were passed through a tiny window.</p>
<p>When he learned that the Tartar had scaled the ramparts, he hurried to hide himself in a large wooden chest, saying to his servant, &ldquo;Lock it from the outside, keep the key and don&rsquo;t give it to the robbers when they ask for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>(Chao Ye Xian Zai by Zhang Zu of the early eighth century)</p>
