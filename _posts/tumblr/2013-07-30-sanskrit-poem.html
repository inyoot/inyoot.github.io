<p>Although I conquer all the earth,<br/>yet for me there is only one city.<br/>In that city there is for me only one house;<br/>And in that house, one room only;<br/>And in that room, a bed.<br/>And one woman sleeps there,<br/>The shining joy and jewel of all my kingdom.<br/>(Translated by John Brough)</p>
