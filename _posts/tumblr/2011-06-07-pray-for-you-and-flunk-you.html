<p>A. T. Robertson was a famous Bible teacher and a beloved seminary lecturer. He was also known as a tough professor. At the time, students would stand in class and recite from memory long passages from their assigned books. Sometimes it went well for students; other times it didn&rsquo;t. Once after a particularly poor performance, Dr. Robertson said to a student, &ldquo;Well, excuse me, brother, but all I can do for you is pray for you and flunk you.</p>
