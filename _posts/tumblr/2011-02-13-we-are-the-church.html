<p>I am the church! You are the church!<br/>We are the church together!<br/>All who follow Jesus all around the world!<br/>Yes, we&rsquo;re the church together!</p>
<p>The church is not a building,<br/>the church is not a steeple, <br/>the church is not a resting place,<br/>the church is a people.</p>
